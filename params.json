{"name":"patchwork","tagline":"secure p2p sharing tool","body":"Patchwork is a p2p social-sharing tool for the desktop. Its features include:\r\n\r\n - Public markdown newsfeeds\r\n - End-to-end encrypted private messaging\r\n - Communication over WiFi\r\n - No sign-in, and smooth offline operation\r\n - GPL licensed\r\n\r\nWhat's interesting about patchwork? It uses the Secure Scuttlebutt protocol.\r\n\r\n 1. The network doesnt use hosts or central authorities. Users publish signed data-logs, which are gossiped through the network.\r\n 2. Users are identified by pubkeys. The social profiles and follow-graph are published on the logs to identify users, similar to PGP's Web of Trust.\r\n 3. Log entries are typed JSON entries with content-addressed links to messages, file-blobs, and other logs. Its API is accessible through the Scuttlebot server.\r\n 4. Exchanging only in LAN mode creates a [Sneakernet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
